                        <a><img src="./image/Judith and Holofernes.png" alt=""></a>
                        <p>Judith was the biblical heroine who seduced and then decapitated General Holofernes in order to save her home city of Bethulia from destruction by the enemy, the Assyrian army. As an example of virtue overcoming vice, the subject was quite popular among Old Masters, a typical example is Judith Beheading Holofernes by Caravaggio.</p>
                        <h4>Judith and Holofernes<br>1901</h4>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a><img src="./image/The Three Ages of Woman.png" alt=""></a>
                        <p>The painting is an example of Klimt's symbolic and allegorial works. He continued to paint such images right until his death in 1918.<br><br>The painting show a little girl in the protecting arms of a young woman, while beside them an old woman stands with bowed head. The aged crone is symbolic of the passage of time.</p>
                        <h4>The Three Ages of Woman<br>1905</h4>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a><img src="./image/Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I.png" alt=""></a>
                        <p>The portrait is notable for the mix of naturalism, in the painting of the face and hands, and the ornamental decoration used for the dress, chair and background. Like Judith and the Head of Holofernes the way in which the decoration cuts across the shoulders and forearms creates an impression of mutilation. Since Adele, the subject of both of these works, was one of Klimt's mistresses, it is difficult not to look for a psychological reason for the disjointing of the head and body.</p>
                        <h4>Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I<br>1907</h4>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a><img src="./image/The kiss.png" alt=""></a>
                        <p>The Kiss representing the apex of his "Golden Period," this concludes similar thematic studies during his career, such as The Beethoven Frieze, and The Tree of Life. Each work aids final comprehension of the allegory, which represents the mystical union of spiritual and erotic love and the merging of the individual with the eternal cosmos. </p>
                        <h4>The Kiss<br>1908</h4>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a><img src="./image/death and life.png" alt=""></a>
                        <p>Death and life is always Klimt's central themes, central also to his contemporaries, among them Edvard Munch and Egon Schiele. Klimt makes of it a modern dance of death, but unlike Schiele, he introduces a note of hope and reconciliation, instead of feeling threatened by the figure of death, his human beings seem to disregard it. Only pure colors are used in this painting, and Gustav Klimt sculpted the figures in his canvase in soft rounded contours.</p>
                        <h4>Death And Life<br>1908</h4>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a><img src="./image/Fulfilment.png" alt=""></a>
                        <p>Fulfilment reworks the theme from the last section of the Beethoven Frieze, The Choir of the Angels of Paradise, and predates The Kiss.<br><br>Klimt often seems to have contrasted square or rectangular shapes with circles and spirals to illustrate the difference between masculinity and femininity. The overlapping of the two shapes seems to suggest a sort of physical and spiritual union achieved by the couple.</p>
                        <h4>Fulfilment<br>1909</h4>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a><img src="./image/Womand in Black Feather Hat.png" alt=""></a>
                        <p>This particular simplistic work is a far cry from Klimt's complex paintings of the past ten years.<br><br>The monochromatic pinky-brown palette and highly stylized drawing of Woman in a Black Feather Hat demonstrates Klimt's growing interest in Expressionism through his friendship with the young Egon Schiele. The movement's growing interest was the expression of human suffering and emotions through the heightened impact of strong colors and distortion of form.</p>
                        <h4>Womand in Black Feather Hat Drawing<br>1910 </h4>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a><img src="./image/Lady with fan.png" alt=""></a>
                        <p>A study of Gustav Klimt's favorite subject, the female form, "Lady with Fan" reflects both the influence of the Japonism trend in modern art and Klimt's distinctive style. As one of the Viennese artist's later works, the painting's date of completion was 1918, the year Klimt died.</p>
                        <h4>Lady with Fan<br>1918</h4>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <a><img src="./image/The bride.png" alt=""></a>
                        <p>When Klimt died, an unfinished painting entitled The Bride was left in his studio. The right half was dominated by a semi-naked female figure. <br><br>As the art historian Alessandra Comini described it, "The knees were bent and the legs splayed out to expose a carefully detailed pubic area on which the artist had leisurely begun to paint an overlay 'dress' of suggestive and symbolic ornamental shapes."</p>
